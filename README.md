# customer_personality-analysis

       This is a customer segmentation project in which we analyse the customer's data and divide them in 
       groups on the basis of their purchasing behaviours. Income,Expenditure,Marital status,education,
       kids,amount spent on different types of items are some of the deciding factors in grouping 
       the customers.
